As a condition of your use of the Sites and Services, you agree to provide Goohyeah with true, accurate, current and complete information as prompted by the Goohyeah registration forms, when registering for or using the Sites and Services and update and maintain the truthfulness, accuracy and completeness of such information.

Further, you are responsible for all activities that occur in connection with such access credentials, including use of the Services, all instructions electronically transmitted, or any data or information obtained using your access credentials.   Neither Goohyeah shall be under any duty to inquire as to the authority or propriety of any instructions given to Goohyeah by you or via your access credentials and shall be entitled to act upon any such instructions, and neither Goohyeah shall be liable for any loss, cost, expense or other liability arising out of any such instructions. Accordingly, you should take steps to protect the confidentiality of your access credentials. As an authorized user of the Service, you accept full responsibility for the monitoring of your accounts. Notify Goohyeah immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized activity, disclosure, loss, theft or other unauthorized use of your access credentials. You agree to cooperate with Goohyeah in any investigation and agree to take corrective measures to protect your accounts from further fraudulent activity.

Goohyeah reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, terminate your rights to use Goohyeah Sites and Services, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion, at any time and with or without notice. Goohyeah shall not be liable to any user or other third party for any such modification, update, suspension or discontinuance.
