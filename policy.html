                                    Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services.  At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not settled on standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, Goohyeah and the Site do not recognize DNT.
